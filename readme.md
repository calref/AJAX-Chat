AJAX Chat CalRef-Bleeding
=========

This is the standalone version of Blueimp's AJAX Chat featuring changes made by CalRef.

AJAX stands for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML".
The AJAX Chat clients (the user browsers) use JavaScript to query the web server for updates.
Instead of delivering a complete HTML page only updated data is sent in XML format.
By using JavaScript the chat page can be updated without having to reload the whole page.


Requirements
============

###Server-Side:
- PHP >= 4
- MySQL >= 4


###Client-Side:
- Enabled JavaScript
- Enabled Cookies
